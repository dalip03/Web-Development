            I did my schooling in Govt Model Sn. secondary school and I got 88%. <br><br>

            Then I joined as staff trainee in roots industries and here I worked in the production department and I
            learned the process of manufacturing, how the product is manufactured from raw material to final to
            customer. <br> <br>

            My hobbies are listening to songs, travelling to new places and playing badminton. <br><br>

            Coming to my weakness, as now I don't have any weaknesses in future if I get any weaknesses and I am sure
